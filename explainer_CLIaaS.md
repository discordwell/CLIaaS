## Problem We Solved (2-3 sentences)
Teams get trapped inside SaaS tools because migration workflows are manual, brittle, and expensive. CLIaaS makes migration scriptable and repeatable by treating interoperability as a first-class command-line workflow. Users can import from existing platforms, normalize data, and export to compatible formats without one-off custom scripts.
