# High-Level Video Plan (CLIaaS)

Date: 2026-02-22

## Positioning Copy

- "AI lives in the command line"
- "Now, so does your helpdesk"

## Model Baseline To Highlight

We are positioning CLIaaS around current frontier model access instead of SaaS-vendor wrappers:

- GPT 5.3
- Claude Opus 4.6
- Claude Sonnet 4.6
- Kimi K2.5
- Gemini 3.1

Core message:
No more waiting on your SaaS to release their "custom" janky frontier model reskins. Our agentic harnesses are built using future-proofed standards: MCP, agents.md, and claude.md.

## Video Sequence

We will publish tool-in-action videos that progress from migration to custom automation.

1. Migration kickoff (simple)
Prompt: "chat, I'm tired of Kayako. Install cliaas and send it"
Focus: Show a fast migration from a legacy helpdesk to CLIaaS, including export, normalization, and first-ticket handling.

2. Operational automation (complex)
Prompt: "hi Claude, send me an email when something breaks."
Focus: Show Claude creating and running a custom ticket-volume anomaly detection script and wiring alerting for break/failure conditions.

## Narrative Arc

1. Escape legacy UI lock-in.
2. Adopt CLI-native support operations.
3. Move from guided assistance to autonomous, model-authored workflows.
