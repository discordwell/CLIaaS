{"id":"demo-msg-210","ticketId":"demo-4521","author":"Jane Smith","body":"We keep having incidents where two agents reply to the same ticket within seconds of each other, sending contradictory answers to customers.

{"id":"demo-msg-211","ticketId":"demo-4521","author":"pat.oconnor","body":"This is a known pain point. We have a 'ticket locking' feature in beta — when an agent opens a ticket, others see a banner saying 'Sarah is viewing this ticket' and replies are queued rather than sent immediately.

{"id":"demo-msg-221","ticketId":"demo-4522","author":"alex.kumar","body":"For bulk imports, use our CLI tool: cliaas import --format csv --input ./historical.csv --preserve-timestamps.
