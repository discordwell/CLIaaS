## 2026-02-22T20:00Z — Session 9: Bug Fixes & Visual Fidelity
- Fixed 3 critical bugs: RAF throttling, edge scroll drift, input event ordering
- Added fog of war, procedural terrain, particle effects, death fade, selection circles
- Improved health bars, unit info panel, fog-aware minimap
- Rate-limited AI scanning, pathfinding swap-and-pop optimization
- Committed 88b515a

## 2026-02-22T18:30Z — Session 8: Native TS Ant Mission Engine
- Replaced WASM/Emscripten Easter egg with pure TypeScript/Canvas 2D game engine
- Built 10 engine modules: types, assets, camera, input, entity, map, pathfinding, renderer, scenario, index
- Asset pipeline: MIX→SHP→PNG extraction (27 sprites), procedural ant sprite generation (3 ant types)
- SHP parser fixed: 14-byte KeyFrameHeaderType header, 8-byte offset entries with bit-masked flags
- MIX decryption: RSA + Blowfish ECB working for encrypted MIX archives
- Ant sprites (ANT1-3.SHP) not in freeware CS download — generated red/orange/green ants procedurally
- Game renders terrain, sprites from original game data, minimap, selection, health bars
- Selection (left click), movement commands (right click), combat, ant HUNT AI all functional
- Win/lose conditions with 3-second grace period, mission accomplished/failed overlays
- tsconfig.json: excluded `scripts/` dir to avoid BigInt/ES2020 build errors
- Cleaned up 9 debug scripts

## 2026-02-22T08:00Z — Session 7: Wave 5 — Live Demo Pipeline
- Saved API keys (Anthropic + OpenAI) to .env from master.env
- Created scripts/seed-zendesk.ts, seeded 25 realistic tickets into Zendesk (billing, auth, bugs, features, onboarding, API, account)
- Re-exported Zendesk: 26 tickets, 26 messages, 3 users, 1 org, 1 KB, 21 rules
- Added `import 'dotenv/config'` to cli/index.ts (no more `-r dotenv/config` needed)
- Configured Claude as LLM provider, validated all 4 workflows: triage, draft, kb suggest, summarize
- Updated src/lib/data.ts: multi-source export loading (merges all export dirs), added 'kayako-classic' source
- Redesigned landing page: hero, live CLI terminal demo, connector badges (3 live), workflow cards, LLM providers, routes, footer
- Updated explainer: team=Robert Cordwell, added Kayako Classic connector, mentioned live Zendesk data
- Deployed to cliaas.com (build passes, site returns 200)
- Captured 1440x2296 full-page screenshot via Playwright
- Fixed make_submission_zip.sh (mkdir for zip output path), created submission bundle (52MB)
- Two commits pushed: 1f21227 (main changes) + 892021d (screenshot + zip fix)
